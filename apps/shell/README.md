## Principles

Treffwerk is built on six core principles:

1. **Purpose Over Profit**: We measure success by the depth of our impact, not by revenue or scale.
2. **Community-Centered Action**: We prioritize solving problems at a local level, creating benefits for real communities.
3. **Radical Transparency**: Everything we build, decide, and learn is visible to our members and the public.
4. **Empowering Privacy**: Privacy, anonymity, and control over your data are not optional - they are essential.
5. **Equity and Accessibility**: Everything we do should be fair and accessible. Anyone can contribute and participate.
6. **Creative Resistance**: We use creativity and innovation as our weapons against inequality and injustice.
